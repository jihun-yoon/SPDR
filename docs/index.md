# Stock Price Reasoner with Deep Research

Welcome to the documentation for the Stock Price Reasoner with Deep Research system. This documentation explains the working principles, architecture, and usage of our implementation based on the iterative deep search approach.

## What is Deep Research?

Deep Research is an advanced approach to information retrieval and analysis that goes beyond traditional RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems. It implements an iterative loop of searching, reading, and reasoning until an optimal answer is found or a token budget is exceeded.

The key principles include:
- Continuous search-read-reason cycles
- Memory management for tracking acquired knowledge
- Progressive knowledge building
- Budget-aware processing
