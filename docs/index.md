## What is Deep Research?

Deep Research is an advanced approach to information retrieval and analysis that goes beyond traditional RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems. It implements an iterative loop of searching, reading, and reasoning until an optimal answer is found or a token budget is exceeded.

The key principles include:
- **Iterative Exploration**: Continuous search-read-reason cycles
- **Memory Management**: Tracking acquired knowledge throughout the research process
- **Progressive Knowledge Building**: Gradually improving understanding through multiple iterations
- **Self-Evaluation**: The system evaluates its own research progress and quality
- **Budget-Aware Processing**: Effective resource allocation within token constraints

## Reading Sequence for New Users

If you're new to the system, we recommend following this reading sequence:

1. Start with [Deep Search Principles](deep_search_principles.md) to understand the core concepts
2. Follow the [Installation Guide](installation.md) to set up the system
3. Use the [Quick Start Guide](quick_start.md) to run your first research query
4. Review the [Architecture Overview](architecture.md) to understand how the system is designed
5. Explore [Example Scenarios](examples.md) to see the system in action
6. Refer to the [API Reference](api_reference.md) when you need detailed implementation information
